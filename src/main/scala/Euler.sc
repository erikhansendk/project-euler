  * To slow, try:
  *
  * Sieve of Eratosthenes
  *
  * The algorithm needs to have an upper limit for the primes to find. Lets call this limit N
  *
  * The algorithm works as follows.
  *
  * Create a list l of consecutive integers {2,3,â€¦,N}.
  * Select p as the first prime number in the list, p=2.
  * Remove all multiples of p from the l.
  * set p equal to the next integer in l which has not been removed.
  * Repeat steps 3 and 4 until p2 > N, all the remaining numbers in the list are primes
