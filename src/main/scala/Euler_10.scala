      * My calc-primes method in Euler_07 is to show - Sieve of Eratosthenes to the rescue..
      *
      * Sieve of Eratosthenes was as the name implies invented by Eratosthenes who was a Greek Mathematician living around 200 BC.
      *
      * The algorithm needs to have an upper limit for the primes to find. Lets call this limit N
      *
      * The algorithm works as follows.
      *
      * Create a list l of consecutive integers {2,3,â€¦,N}.
      * Select p as the first prime number in the list, p=2.
      * Remove all multiples of p from the l.
      * set p equal to the next integer in l which has not been removed.
      * Repeat steps 3 and 4 until p2 > N, all the remaining numbers in the list are primes
